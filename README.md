# B-machine 

This is small research project with a traget to understand a structure of a software PLC

## TODO

* Add a block "AssignIf"
* Add a block "Select2"
* Add a block "Mux"
* Add a block "Demux"

## Next steps

Now I can implement a relative simple program, even I can say a linear program.
But some things are missing:

+ Branches (Jump)
+ Subroutines

I don't know yet how to implement this within my model :)
